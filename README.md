# sokar-omp

Runs [Oh My Pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (`omp`) inside
[Sokar](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar): in a hardened container, reaching only what it needs,
with your credential kept on the machine and its work waiting for your review. It is not
[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), which [sokar-pi](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar-pi)
adapts.

## Install

Once Sokar's package repository is set up, as Sokar's
[getting started](https://github.com/sokar-ai/sokar/blob/main/doc/getting-started.md) describes:

```
sudo apt install sokar-agent-omp      # or: sudo dnf install sokar-agent-omp
```

How to sign in, start a task, what the task reaches and what to read when it does not work:
