"""
Adds the CLI this agent installs to its bill of materials.

The package does not contain that CLI - the image build fetches it from a pinned URL and
checks it against a digest - so nothing that reads the Maven dependency graph can know about
it. A bill that omits the largest thing an image installs is worse than no bill, so it is
recorded here and marked as fetched rather than shipped.

Read from the FILTERED definition in target/classes rather than from the POM: that is the file
the agent binary answers `describe` with, so the version and digest recorded are the ones an
image build will actually use.

    add-fetched-cli.py <bom.json> <agent.yaml> <component-name>

The name is an argument because two agents fetch a CLI this way and the file is otherwise the
same in both repositories. It has to match what `compare-bills.py --expect-moved` is given, or
the update gate watches for a component that is not there and stops on nothing.
