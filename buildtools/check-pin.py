Checks that everything naming the pinned Oh My Pi version says the same thing.

Nothing enforced this before. A bot that writes one place and not another would ship a package
whose definition advertises a version its own payload does not install, and no test would
notice until an image build failed on somebody else's machine.

Read from the FILTERED definition in target/classes, not from src: that is the file the agent
binary answers 'describe' with, so it is what an image build will actually use. Reading the
source template would check the template and prove nothing about the build.

    check-pin.py [--definition target/classes/agent/claude.yaml] [--offline]

Four questions, in the order they get cheaper to be wrong about:

    1  the version is a version, not an unsubstituted ${...} - filtering happened at all
    2  it is the version pom.xml pins
    3  the download URL names that same version
    4  the digest is the one Anthropic publishes for it   (--offline skips this one)

The fourth is the only one that can drift in this repository today, and it is the one that
needs the network: the version travels into the definition, the URL and both package
descriptions by resource filtering, so those cannot disagree. The digest is typed in.

Exit codes:

    0   they agree
    1   they do not
    2   the question could not be answered - the manifest was unreachable, which is not agreement
